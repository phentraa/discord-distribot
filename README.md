# discord-distribot
A Discord bot - written in Python 3 - who helps colleagues get the information they are really interested in.

---
### Main goal:
See all the messages, events and resources I'm involved in in one place.  
(Without having to fiddle around with different channels.)

### What does the bot do:
- Read all channels on the Discord server
- When a message tagged by the name of the bot:
  - Collect all other tags (groups, roles as well as persons)
  - Distributes the message via DM for the tagged persons (without duplications)

### Result
I will see all the relevant, up-to-date information for me in the direct message thread with the bot.
